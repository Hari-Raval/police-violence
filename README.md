# Final Project for AC 209A: Police Violence in the USA

##### Team Members: Hari Raval, David Berthiaume, Jessica Fang

## Overview 

Excessive police violence is a rampant issue in the United States. Police departments have often been placed under scrutiny for the use of unreasonable and discriminatory coercive actions against civilians. Analysis of fatal police shootings data, Census Bureau data, and FBI law enforcement data uncovers the factors and manners of discrimination that contribute to the application of coercive force, often leading to a fatal shooting. 

In this work, we classify whether a shooting will occur or not at the zip code tabulation area by applying logistic regression, random forest, boosting, and neural network modeling approaches. Moreover, we formulate a technique to assign risk scores to areas indicating the likelihood of a police fatal shooting.
